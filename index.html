                        It is a group project which was build to help the COVID-19 dedicated hospitals and persons. My part was to build the front-end dashboard and merge it with current time geolocation; which was implemented with Google Geocoding API. Our group brought the best out of it.

It was fun to interact with JS for the first time.
